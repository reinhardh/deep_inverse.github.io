All accepted papers are availabe at [openreview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2020/Workshop/Deep_Inverse#accept-oral).


# Workshop Summary

Learning-based methods, and in particular deep neural networks, have emerged as highly successful and universal tools for image and signal recovery and restoration. They achieve state-of-the-art results on tasks ranging from image denoising, image compression, and image reconstruction from few and noisy measurements. They are starting to be used in important imaging technologies, for example in GEs newest computational tomography scanners and in the newest generation of the iPhone.

The field has a range of theoretical and practical questions that remain unanswered. In particular, learning and neural network-based approaches often lack the guarantees of traditional physics-based methods. Further, while superior on average, learning-based methods can make drastic reconstruction errors, such as hallucinating a tumor in an MRI reconstruction or turning a pixelated picture of Obama into a white male.

This virtual workshop aims at bringing together theoreticians and practitioners in order to chart out recent advances and discuss new directions in deep neural network-based approaches for solving inverse problems in the imaging sciences and beyond.


# Schedule

The workshop schedule is aligned with 7:30 AM to 4 PM PT; please see this [converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Deep+Inverse+Workshop&iso=20201211T0730&p1=256&ah=8&am=30) for conversion to your specific time zone.

The workshop is livestreamed at [the NeurIPS workshop webpage](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2020/protected/workshop_16113.html). To access this website you need to register for the conference at [https://neurips.cc/](https://neurips.cc/) and be logged in. 

The videos of the talk can also be previewed as of now through [the NeurIPS workshop webpage](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2020/protected/workshop_16113.html). The livestream will play the videos, and each of the talks is followed by a live discussion. You can attend the live discussion either through the live stream or you can join the zoom session. Questions should be asked through rocketchat, and a co-organizer will moderate.

During the designated discussion sessions you can talk to the respective speakers in gather.town. To get the gather.town link, visit the official NeurIPS schedule at [the NeurIPS workshop webpage](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2020/protected/workshop_16113.html).

The poster session is also on gather.town. The gather.town link is accessible through the [the NeurIPS workshop webpage](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2020/protected/workshop_16113.html).

# Call for Papers and Submission Instructions

We invite researchers to submit anonymous papers of up to 4 pages (excluding references and appendices) which will be considered for contributed workshop papers. No specific formatting is required. Authors are encouraged to use the [workshop edition of the NeurIPS style file](https://deep-inverse.org/downloads/NeurIPSDeepInverseStyle.zip), but they may use any other style as long as it has standard font size (11pt) and margins (1in). The paper can have an appendix of unlimited lenght.

Submission at [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2020/Workshop/Deep_Inverse) will be open from Sep. 1 until the submission deadline on October 9, 2020.

We welcome all submission in the intersection of inverse problems and deep learning including contributions related to robustness and biases, neural network architectures, regularization, optimization methods, datasets, theoretical foundations (including rigorous recovery guarantees, provable convergence, and bounds on representation errors),  untrained methods, generative models, end-to-end methods, and applications in imaging, time series, and beyond. We especially encourage submissions related to the following questions:

- Deep learning based approaches can make drastic reconstruction errors and may introduce biases. How common are such issues, can such reconstruction difficulties be alleviated, and if yes, how? 

- Deep learning based approaches often lack the guarantees of the traditional physics based methods. What theoretical results are necessary and possible?

- Untrained neural networks such as the deep image prior have shown that neural networks alone, without any learning, can give excellent reconstruction performance. How important is training on the target distribution for imaging performance and is it possible to achieve state-of-the art performance without training?
