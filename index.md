title: Deep Learning and Inverse Problems
description: NeurIPS 2021 workshop, Monday December 13, Online

# Workshop Description

Learning-based methods, and in particular deep neural networks, have emerged as highly successful and universal tools for image and signal recovery and restoration. They achieve state-of-the-art results on tasks ranging from image denoising, image compression, and image reconstruction from few and noisy measurements. They are starting to be used in important imaging technologies, for example in GEs newest computational tomography scanners and in the newest generation of the iPhone. They are also used in inverse problems beyond imaging, including for solving inverse problems arrising in communications, signal processing, and even on non-Euclidean data suchs as graphs.

The field has a range of theoretical and practical questions that remain unanswered, including questions about guarantees, robustness, architectural design, the role of learning, domain specific applications, and more. 
This virtual workshop aims at bringing together theoreticians and practitioners in order to chart out recent advances and discuss new directions in deep learning-based approaches for solving inverse problems in the imaging sciences and beyond. 


# Call for Papers and Submission Instructions

We invite researchers to submit anonymous papers of up to 4 pages (excluding references and appendices) which will be considered for contributed workshop papers. No specific formatting is required. Authors are encouraged to use the [NeurIPS style file](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/StyleFiles), but they may use any other style as long as it has standard font size (11pt) and margins (1in).

Submission at [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2021/Workshop/Deep_Inverse) is open now until the submission deadline on September 26, 2021.

We welcome all submissions in the intersection of inverse problems and deep learning, including but not limited to submissions on the following topics:

- Deep learning based approaches can make drastic reconstruction errors and may introduce biases. How common are such reconstruction problems, can they be alleviated, and if yes, how?

- Deep learning based approaches often lack the guarantees of the traditional physics based methods. What theoretical results are necessary and possible?

- Coordinate-based signal representations (e.g., NeRF and SIREN) and untrained convolutional neural networks have shown that neural networks alone, without any learning, can give excellent reconstruction performance. Is it possible to achieve state-of-the art performance without or little training data?

# Important Dates

# Schedule

The workshop schedule is aligned with 7:55 AM to 4 PM PT; please see this [converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Deep+Inverse+NeurIPS+2021+workshop&iso=20211213T0755&p1=256&ah=8) for conversion to your specific time zone.

The workshop is livestreamed at [the NeurIPS webpage](https://neurips.cc/). To access this website you need to register for the conference at [https://neurips.cc/](https://neurips.cc/) and be logged in. 

The livestream will play the talks, and each of the talks is followed by a live discussion. You can attend the live discussion either through the live stream or you can join the zoom session. Questions should be asked through rocketchat, and a co-organizer will moderate.

During the designated discussion sessions you can talk to the respective speakers in gather.town. To get the gather.town link, visit the official NeurIPS schedule at [the NeurIPS webpage](https://neurips.cc).

The poster session is also on gather.town. The gather.town link is accessible through the [the NeurIPS webpage](https://neurips.cc/).
